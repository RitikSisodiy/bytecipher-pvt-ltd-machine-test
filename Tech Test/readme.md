# **NTI Display System**
This project models the Next Train Indicator (NTI) display system as a UI component in a mobile application. The display shows the trains arriving at a platform within the next 15 minutes based on the current simulated time.

## **Train Schedules**
For the purposes of this project, the following train schedules are used:

- Central -> Station: Every 20 minutes
- Circular: Every hour on the hour
- North Square: Every 12 minutes from 07:00 until 22:00
- West Market: Every 6 minutes from 05:30 until 01:30
## **Usage**
The output will be a display of the expected trains arriving at the platform within the next 15 minutes based on the current simulated time.

## **Requirements**
 - Python 3
## **How to run the code**
Open a terminal in the project directory
Run the following command: 
 - python main.py

The program will begin at 05:00 VT and simulate the arrival of trains according to the schedules listed in the problem statement.
